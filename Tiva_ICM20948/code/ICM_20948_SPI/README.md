# Tiva ICM20948 SPI project
Project that communicates with the ICM-20948 9â€‘Axis MEMS MotionTracking Device through SPI. Currently, the code already takes care of the low-level SPI and communication with the device. 
## Application-specific APIs
Application-Specific APIs have been created to simplify the process of communicating with the device through SPI without needing to know low-level SPI details associated with the Ti Tiva. 
They are: <br />
`ICM_SPI_Write(uint32_t ui32Register, uint32_t ui32Value)` which writes a specific value to a register, and <br />
`ICM_SPI_Read(uint32_t ui32Register)` which returns the value of a register <br />

These APIs can be used to initialize the device and retrieve sensor data <br />
